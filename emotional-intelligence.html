              What is Emotional Intelligence?
            </h3>
            <p class="awnser-1">
              Emotional intelligence is the conscious or unconscious act of relating to your immediate environment or other people. It could be the ability to pay attention to what is present in your life, weather that be taking things at face value or reading between the lines, both are valid responses but knowing how to respond appropriately is true emotional intelligence. For instance if someone is saying one thing but your intuition tells you they actually mean something else - that could be emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence could aid you in reading a room, knowing how to compose yourself appropriate to each situation you are faced with in your daily experience.

                How is it different to IQ?
              </h3>
              <p class="em-int-a-2">
                IQ almost feels like as if it Is a measurement of a container (our brain). IQ can tell us a lot about both a persons comprehension skills and their ability to retain and repeat back information. The tropes typically found at either end of the IQ spectrum are “smart” or “dumb”. This isn’t necessarily a correct or fair representation of the individual either. High IQ does not equal high EQ.

                  For understanding ourselves, others and how we relate to our environments and life events. Emotional intelligence can help us rationalise or make sense of bad situations and possibly be less reactive to them. It can also help extend the periods of joy or content that we experience from positive events, making them linger onward and trickle into other parts of our life. It’s important because it’s important to enjoy your life.
