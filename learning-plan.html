            What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-1">
            Good lord I dont really know. I guess thats partly why im doing this, as a way of giving myself some options. Ideally I would like to do something creative and self-directed. There have been times where I was able to work successfully as a freelance artist / illustrator but it never had any longevity. I think learning code will let me do that but in a way thats integrated within an established industry so that there is some structure / procedure there to guide my time management. Freelancing as an artist was difficult because the entire thing felt like a grey area between the amount of time it takes to actually produce things and client expectation.

            A description of your strength and limitations when it comes to learning.
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-4">
            I think one of my strengths when it comes to learning is my passionate and obsessive nature. I really become consumed by whatever it is I am engaging myself in. My biggest limitation is definitely my nit-pickiness. I get really caught up on the niche, micro-details sometime and can end up missing out on the bigger picture. For example with the blog challenge I ended up wasting many hours on trying to figure out a work around for autoplaying media inside google chrome and in turn was left with barely any time to fulfil the actual brief.
