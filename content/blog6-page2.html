            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>

            I definitely would like to improve my ability to work in a team and also improve my communication skills. For my whole life I’ve been very rogue and have struggled to work in groups. I think it may be because I’m an only child so I’m far more comfortable working on my own but I would like for that to change. I also have a bit of trouble recognising and raising a flag when I need help. Often I do this too late.

          <h3 class="question-4">
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
          </h3>

            I think I would like to make my work schedule a bit more fixed. Currently I am putting in 8 hours per day but the time of day in which that starts is constantly in flux which makes it tricky to communicate with others and receive help when I need it as others may be logged out for the day and I really don’t want to end up in a position where I am relying on others help after hours.
            When things become too much for me I will reach out and seek help where I can and where it is available. I think I let my ego get in the way of that sometimes.
