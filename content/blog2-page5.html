            Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

            Yeah I was really confused about the difference between branching and forking but the video from rainbow poet with the visual reference to replicating a repository really helped. I now understand that a branch is a path coming off of a main directory, while a fork is an entire copy of that main directory which could have its' own branches coming off of it.

            Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-18">
            I kind of... didn't get frustrated. I had done a bunch of revision just before i started the blog task and so it all just kinda fell into place, i didn't encounter any real issues. I guess I was mildly frustrated at myself it that regard, I have this pattern where if I solve a problem successfully it inflates my ego and I can become a bit of a know it all. Just seeing that pattern play out again is frustrating for me, it can impair my ability to learn at times.

          If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

          I really didn't expect it to actualise so immediately. The fact that i could open index.html and be taken to a webpage with text on it amazed me. I just imagined there were a lot more steps to be taken before the work would actually appear in a web browser. I had imagined the process to actually run an .html file would take alot more. It's definitely helped me realise the potential in what I've learnt this week.
