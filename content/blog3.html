          With a pounding headache, your eyes open. You've been asleep for a long, long time. As you begin to regain conciousness you notice a wet sensation on your back, the carpet sloshes as you stir and slump yourself up. You put on your google glasses™ and see that the puddle you've been 
          lying in is coolant! The glowing blue liquid sopps and flows out the side of a nearby CPU. The room is in quite a state. Pondering this for some time you still arent exactly sure how you got here and wonder if maybe it could even have been you who trashed the place. The thought sends
          a chill down your spine but you shake it off and heave yourself upright. It's cold now, how long were you lying in that coolant for? It can't be good for you. Wind is billowing in through the battered windows, it's glass looks like it was blown out a long time ago. As it hammers 
          and swirls it's way around the room it brings with it a pair of monarch butterflies. They draw nearer and you notice they both have the Tesla™ logo on their wings... the perlescent Tesla™ sheen flicks and flashes the strange rooms' dull filtered light at you and not long after you fall
          into a state of hypnosis.
