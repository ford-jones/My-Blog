            What's the difference between git and GitHub?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-5">
            Git is a programme used to remember, manages and control the command line and different sets of code.
            Github is an open source website which allows uses to share, track and work simultaneously on code projects without conflict.
           </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="question-6">
            Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-6">
            If the computer were a human brain, git would be the part that compartmentalises and comprehends the information it is given. While GitHub is like a social media platform, where we can share(push) the thoughts(data/code) that the brain(git) has conceptualised(committed).

          <h3 class="question-7">
            Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-7">
            I think so yes, but I could always revise the material if I needed to.
          </p>

            <h3 class="question-8">
              Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
            </h3>
            <p class="awnser-8">
              I made some effort to but gave myself some flexibility regarding how the time within the half-hour block was allocated.

              What is a Git workflow?

              A series of steps regarding git and its commands which allow developers to maintain order when working with big blocks of code.
