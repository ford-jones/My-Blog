            The Padding:
         </h3>
          <p class="awnser-1">
            Now, if you consider the example of an image or some text. Imagine you're formatting your websites layout and you want to move your element. The element has a border. Where does it sit? is it right against the edge of the image / text 
            or it it further away? maybe there is some space between it? That space, is the padding. In form with margins and borders, padding also has 4 sides which have values that can be manipulated to further enrich our elements'
            positioning. But to conceptualise the padding, do we need a rendered border? No, because even if no border has been defined it still exists at the default 0px x 0px values. That goes both ways too, if you had a big border that butted right
            up against your image or text with no negative space at all, the padding still exists, its value is just set at 0px. This same rule can be applied to each of the 3 commands for
            positioning elements, they all still exist at their default value even if they are not in play.
