            What is your process so far for solving problems?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-20">
            At this stage in the programme I am definitely noticing that I have two different reactions to problems. I'm either pulling my hair out or allowing myself to disolve into distractions. I do find that getting up and going to make a cup of tea / just getting away from the computer for a seacond can help by moving my brain somewhere else momentarily. It's kind of a hopeful aproach and maybe not always the most useful as it's kind of an avoidant aproach to problem solving and you may not actually learn anything about WHY that was a problem for you in that moment even if you do manage to solve it and find a solution. I think learning to think like a programmer will help transition away from an avoidant / hopeful aproach to problems and move closer towards a curious / assertive mode of operations. It makes sense to use the flipped-classroom aproach to learning here, where you can really take the time to fully understand a concept before you move onto other things, building a fortified understanding of the fundamentals before you apply them. In a normal classroom context where you rope-learn a bunch of stuff and then awnser questions it ends up being abit cookie cutter.

            What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-21">
            Quite weird, i was very concious of the fact that i also have a couple friends in the cohort who would be able to see it and i wondered if i would be judged (on a friendly level of course). But I also think it's a nice excersise to do and i enjoyed reading other peoples introductions!

            Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-22">
            Deffinitely a little. Largely because the reason I'm doing DEV is to further my practice as an arist, and artists are always a little self-absorbed. You kind of have to be to make good art. Was certainly feeling a little self concious, i referred to that in the statement above.
