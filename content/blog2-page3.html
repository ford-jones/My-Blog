            What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-10">
            Working with cheatsheets etc... made things a lot easier. I found I was able to delegate most of my brain power to the actual problem solving at hand as opposed to memorising terminology.

            Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-11">
            Skim read the things I already knew / know and re-read the things I don't. I gave everything pretty much equal attention and don't think I've retained all of the information I could have if I prioritised my focus a bit better.

          <h3 class="question-12">
            How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-12">
            Imagine a photoshoot. When you are coding, it's like you are curating the contents of the photoshoot and what you are going to see in the picture. Staging is "almost" like the finalisation of that process. When you stage something, you are essentially saying "The clutter is gone and everything is exactly where it should be". Once the shoot is curated and the code is staged, the photographer can then take the photo. Committing is sort of like that act of taking the photo, it creates a timestamped snapshot of how the code looked at that exact point in time.
