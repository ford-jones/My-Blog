         <h3 class="question-1">
          In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
         </h3>
         <p class="awnser-1">
          The command line is essentially a text based way of navigating your computer. It is a catalogue of every single file on your computer, including the ones you can't see. It's like reading a book with no pictures :p

         <h3 class="question-2">
          Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
         </h3>
         <p class="awnser-2">
          I tried my best to but also had to allow myself to divert from the time suggestions to make sure I properly understood the material before moving onward. Maybe skim read first, then make an attempt and if it fails THEN go back and read thoroughly.
         </p>

            Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-3">
            <ul class="awnser-3">
              <li>1.`cd` change directory: Allows you to move into the folders of your computer.</li>
              <li>2.`ls` list: Will list everything inside of that particular folder / directory.</li>
              <li>3.`mkdir` make directory: Will make a folder / directory inside of the directory you are currently in.</li>
              <li>4.`touch` Make file: Will make a file inside of the folder / directory you are currently inside of.</li>
              <li>5.`cat` Read document: Cat will show you / read out the content of any file in any directory.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
          <h3 class="question-4">
            Did you learn anything unexpected?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-4">
            Yes! That failed code does not equal failure as a coder. Code breaks all the time. Even super duper proficient coders will run into walls multiple times per day.
