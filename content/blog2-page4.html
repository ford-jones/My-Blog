            What is main?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-13">
            The main branch is the "home" directory. All of the polished, flawless code resides there. Edits to code shouldn't happen here as you risk creating faulty code in the home directory, the main is where code that has been edited in a branch will be merged into after polishing following a pull request.
          </p>

          <h3 class="question-14">
            Why create a Branch?
          </h3>
          <p class="awnser-14">
            To work on a mirror image of the main directory safely without the potential of creating bad code / syntax in the main directory.

        <h3 class="question-15">
          Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
        </h3>
        <p class="awnser-15">
          Yeah they feel pretty intuitive, it makes sense that you wouldn't work in the main branch. You could ruin everything!!
        </p>
       </div>
       <div>
        <h3 class="question-16">
          What are some examples of when you would fork?
        </h3>
        <p class="awnser-16">
          When you want to work on a set of code without risking any changes to the main repository, e.g. open source or public projects. You can also use it if you want a template / starting point for your own project.
