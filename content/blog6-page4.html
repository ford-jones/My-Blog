            On Thursdays I have to see my psychotherapist at 5pm every week which takes about two hours out of my day if I include travel time and also unwinding (shower, cup of tea etc).
I also go to my grandmas house every Sunday at 6pm for a family dinner till about 10pm.
Wednesday nights im usually completely unavailable as a I have dinner at my mums house around 6pm and then from 9pm onwards I raid-lead a group of 25 people in world of warcraft through raid instances. It’s kind of like being the digital version of a conductor of an orchestra. The people I play with come from all around the world and some of them stay up till ungodly hours of the morning to wait for me to come online so I really need to give them at least 24hours notice if that is to be canceled.
